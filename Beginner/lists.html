    <h2>Lists</h2>
    
    <p>This is how you make an unordered lists:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" elements</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>

        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is the ordered list </li>
